In the next section, we will explore Python basics, providing you with a solid foundation for data science programming.

****Python Basics for Data Science****

**Variables, Data Types, and Basic Operations in Python**

**Variables** 

In Python, variables are used to store data values. They can hold various types of data, such as numbers, strings, or lists. Variables are created by assigning a value to a name using the "=" operator.

```python
# Example of variable assignment
x = 233
country = "Ghana"
```

**Data Types**

Data types are an important concept in Python. They define the kind of value that a variable can store and the operations that can be performed on that value.

There are many different data types in Python, but some of the most common ones include:

- **Numeric data types:** These are used to store numbers. The most common numeric data types are integers, floats, and complex numbers.
- **String data types:** These are used to store text. Strings can be enclosed in single or double quotes.
- **Boolean data types:** These are used to store True or False values.
- **Sequence data types:** These are used to store collections of data. The most common sequence data types are lists, tuples, and ranges.
- **Mapping data types:** These are used to store key-value pairs. The most common mapping data type is dictionaries.

Here is an example of different data types in Python:

```python
# Examples of different data types
number = 233
name = "Nana Akufo Addo"
is_president = True # Boolean data type (True or False) 
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] # ordered collections
my_tuple = (10, 20, 30) # immutable sequences
my_dict = {"name": "Emma Inamutila Theofelus", "age": 27, "career": "Government minister"} # key-value pairs
my_set = {1, 2, 3} # unordered collections of unique elements
```

**Basic Arithmetic Operations** 

Python provides a number of operators for performing basic arithmetic operations. 

These operators include :

| Operator  | Symbol | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Addition | + | Adds two numbers together |
| Subtraction  | - | Subtracts two numbers from each other  |
| Multiplication  | * | Multiplies two numbers together |
| Division | / | Divides two numbers and returns the quotient  |
| Modulus | % | Divided two numbers and returns the remainder |
| Exponentiation  | ** | Raises a number to a power |
| Indexing | [] | Accesses a specific element in a sequence.  |
| Integer division | // | Divides two numbers and returns the integer part of the result. |

Here are some examples of how to use these operators in Python:

```python
# Examples of basic operations
x = 10
y = 3
name = "Kumasi"

sum_result = x + y  # Addition: 10 + 3 = 13
sub_result = x - y  # Subtraction: 10 - 3 = 7
mul_result = x * y  # Multiplication: 10 * 3 = 30
div_result = x / y  # Division: 10 / 3 = 3.3333
exp_result = x ** y  # Exponentiation: 10^3 = 1000
mod_result = x % y  # Modulus: 10 % 3 = 1
int_div_result = x // y  # Integer Division: 10 // 3 = 3

greeting = "Hello, " + name  # String concatenation: Hello, Kumasi
first_char = name[0]  # Accessing the first character of a string: K 
```

**Control Flow Statements** 

Control flow statements are used to control the order in which the code in a Python program is executed based on certain conditions. They allow you to make decisions, repeat code, and jump to different parts of the program.

There are three main types of control flow statements in Python:

- **Conditional statements:** These statements allow you to make decisions based on the value of a condition. The most common conditional statement in Python is the if statement.
- **Loop statements:** These statements allow you to repeat code a certain number of times or until a condition is met. The most common loop statements in Python are the for loop and the while loop.
- **Jump statements:** These statements allow you to jump to different parts of the program. The most common jump statements in Python are the break statement and the continue statement.

**Conditional Statements**

The `if` statement is the most common conditional statement in Python. It allows you to make decisions based on the value of a condition. The syntax for the `if` statement is as follows:

```python
if condition:
    # code to be executed if condition is true
else:
    # code to be executed if condition is false
```

For example, the following code would print "The number is even" if the integer variable `number` is even, and "The number is odd" if the integer variable `number` is odd:

```python
number = 10

if number % 2 == 0:
    print("The number is even")
else:
    print("The number is odd")

## Outputs The number is even since 10 is an even number.
```

**Loop Statements**

The `for` loop and the `while` loop are the most common loop statements in Python. The `for` loop is used to repeat a block of code a certain number of times, while the `while` loop is used to repeat a block of code until a condition is met.

The syntax for the `for` loop is as follows:

```python
for variable in iterable:
    # code to be executed for each item in iterable
```

For example, the following code would print the numbers from 1 to 10:

```python
for number in range(1, 11):
    print(number)
```

The syntax for the `while` loop is as follows:

```python
while condition:
    # code to be executed while condition is true
```

For example, the following code would print the numbers from 1 to 10, but would stop if the user entered a negative number:

```python
number = 1

while number >= 0:
    print(number)
    number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
```

**Jump Statements**

The `break` statement and the `continue` statement are used to jump to different parts of the program. The `break` statement is used to terminate the current loop, while the `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current loop iteration and start the next iteration.

For example, the following code would print the numbers from 1 to 10, but would stop if the user entered a negative number:

```python
number = 1

while number >= 0:
    if number < 0:
        break
    print(number)
    number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
```

****Working with Lists, Tuples, and Dictionaries****

Lists, tuples, and dictionaries are three of the most important data structures in Python. They are used to store and organize data in a variety of ways, and they are essential for data science.

************Lists************ 

Lists are a sequence of elements that can be of any type. They are mutable, which means that they can be changed after they are created. Lists are often used to store data that is related in some way. For example, you could use a list to store the names of all the students in a class or the scores of all the players on a sports team.

To create a list, you can use the `list()` function or you can simply enclose a sequence of elements in square brackets. For example, the following code creates a list of the names of the planets in our solar system

```python
planets = ["Mercury", "Venus", "Earth", "Mars", "Jupiter", "Saturn", "Uranus", "Neptune"]
```

You can access elements in a list by their index. The index of the first element in a list is 0, the index of the second element is 1, and so on. For example, the following code prints the first element in the `planets` list:

```python
print(planets[0])
# Mercury
```

You can also use slices to access a range of elements in a list. For example, the following code prints the first three elements in the `planets` list:

```python
print(planets[:3])
# ['Mercury', 'Venus', 'Earth']
```

****Tuples****

Tuples are similar to lists, but they are immutable. This means that they cannot be changed after they are created. Tuples are often used to store data that should not be changed, such as the coordinates of a point on a map or the name and age of a person.

To create a tuple, you can use the `tuple()` function or you can simply enclose a sequence of elements in parentheses. For example, the following code creates a tuple of the coordinates of the North Pole:

```python
north_pole = (90,0)
```

You can access elements in a tuple by their index, just like you can with a list. However, you cannot change the elements in a tuple.

************************Dictionaries************************

Dictionaries are a data structure that maps keys to values. Keys can be of any type, but values must be of a comparable type, meaning that they must be able to be compared using the built-in comparison operators. For example, you could have a dictionary that maps a person's name to their age, where the keys are strings and the values are integers. However, you could not have a dictionary that maps a person's name to their favorite color, where the keys are strings and the values are lists, since lists cannot be compared using the built-in comparison operators 

Dictionaries are often used to store data that is related in a way that can be easily looked up, such as the names of countries and their capital cities.

To create a dictionary, you can use the `dict()` function or you can simply enclose a sequence of key-value pairs in curly braces. For example, the following code creates a dictionary of the capital cities of the countries in Africa:

```python
capitals = {
    "Ghana": "Accra",
    "Kenya": "Nairobi",
    "Togo": "Lome",
    "Tunisia": "Tunis",
    "Mauritius": "Port Louis",
}
```

You can access values in a dictionary by their key. For example, the following code prints the capital city of Togo:

```python
print(capitals["Togo"])
# Lome
```

Dictionaries are a powerful data structure that can be used to store and organize data in a variety of ways. They are essential for data science, and they are a valuable tool for any Python programmer.

In the next section, we will cover writing procedural code , providing you with a solid foundation for data science programming.

********************************Writing Procedural Code******************************** 

Procedural code is a logic statement that one can issue one line at a time. It’s is a type of code that is organized into a series of steps. Each step is a function that performs a specific task. Procedural code is often used in data science to solve problems that can be broken down into a series of steps. 

This approach simplifies complex tasks, promotes code reusability, and enhances the readability of data science projects.

For example, I have a list that contains the names of the three world record holders. Let's see how procedural code can be applied

```python
world_record_holders = ["Hilda Bassey", "Eliud Kipchoge", "Beyoncé"]
```

The code below takes the list above and divides it into three different variables which are the categories that each of the world record holders hold a record in. Then i create sentences from the same 

```python
cooking, athletics, music = world_record_holders  
print(f"{cooking} is indeed a great chef")
print(f"{athletics} has one of the best documentaries On Netflix")

# Hilda Bessey is indeed a great chef
# Eliud Kipchoge has one of the best documentaries on Netflix
```

## Strings In Python

Strings are a sequence of characters, could be letters, numbers, blank spaces, special characters, all grouped together as a unit. They are one of the most basic data types in Python, and they are used in a variety of ways. Strings are often used to store and manipulate text data, and they are also used in data science to extract information from text data.

In this section we will cover how to use strings including string methods, string formatting, manipulating strings, and using unicode strings.

**************************String Quoting************************** 

A string in python is defined when characters or spaces are surrounded by quotes. A string could be done either with a single quote or double quotes as sshown below

```python
# Single Quotes 
'Here is a string'

#Double Quotes
"Here is a string"
```

Both of the above are effectively the same thing so it's really just a preference as to which you use most of the time. 

We also have multi-line strings which allows us to type on multiple lines without having to do a continuation or put in a new line character.

```python
pyladies_ghana_intro = """ PyLadies Ghana is an initiative under the Python Software Community in Ghana (Python Ghana).
Its focus on helping more women become active participants and leaders in the Python open-source community.
"""
```

************************Raw Strings************************ 

Imagine you want to write a string that contains a quotation mark. In Python, you would normally write this as follows:

```python
string = "This is a string with a quotation mark: \")"
```

However, this will not work as expected. The quotation mark inside the string will be interpreted as an escape character, which means that it will be replaced by a literal quotation mark. So, the output of the code will be:

```python
# This is a string with a quotation mark: \")
```

To avoid this, you can use a raw string. A raw string is a string that starts with the letter `r` or `R`. In a raw string, backslashes are not interpreted as escape characters. So, the following code will work as expected:

```python
string = r"This is a string with a quotation mark: \")"
```

The output of this code will be:

```python
# This is a string with a quotation mark: ")"
```

Raw strings are useful when you want to include backslashes or other special characters in a string without having to escape them. For example, you can use raw strings to write Windows paths, regular expressions, or strings that contain newline characters.

```python
path = r"C:\Users\Bard\Desktop\My Documents\titanic.csv"
```

The `r` in front of the path tells Python that it is a raw string. This means that the backslashes in the path will not be interpreted as escape characters. So, the output of the code will be the actual Windows path, which is `C:\Users\Bard\Desktop\My Documents\titanic.csv`
